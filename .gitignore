# .gitignore
# This file is optional to use. Pefectly OK to leave it as is for submission without any changes.
#
# The .gitignore file tells Git which files or patterns to ignore.
# 
# For example, you might want to ignore compiled files,
# log files, system files, or secret configuration files
# that shouldn't be tracked in version control.
#
# You are free to add whatever you like here â€” your teacher
# won't put anything in it.
#
# (Though here's a free Git joke instead...)
#
# Why did Git break up with SVN?
# Because it had too many *commits* issues.

# (Yes, you can ignore this joke too.)
